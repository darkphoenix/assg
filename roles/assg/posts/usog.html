The following paper was written as a writing assingment for the seminar "United States of Google" 
at KIT, about both the intellectual bedrock and growing global influence of the tech sector.
The seminar focused on Silicon Valley, but also touched upon the EU and indeed China at points.
I very much enjoyed both the discussions in the seminar and the research and writing for this
paper, so I figured I'd publish it on my blog as well, maybe somebody finds it interesting.  Also,
I've linked some of the more interesting freely available online sources, these make good further reading
if this subject matter interests you. <br>
<h3 class='sectionHead' id='introduction'><span class='titlemark'>1   </span> <a id='x1-10001'></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>China’s technology sector has rapidly expanded and grown in recent years, both
domestically and across the world. As this growth and indeed every action these
companies take are inextricably linked to the Chinese regime and system of
government, it is important for Western observers to understand their inner workings
to be able to respond to these developments.
</p> 
<p>   Unfortunately the actions of both the Chinese government and companies
operating under its rule are commonly either misunderstood or not given much
thought at all, which leads to both missed opportunities and potentially overlooked
risks. In this paper, I intend to summarise the history of how China’s tech sector
came to be in the form it exists today, the way it is interlinked with the Communist
Party, comment on two major projects currently being advanced by the Party and
their potential consequences, and draw my own conclusions on how the rest of the
world should respond.
</p> 
<p>
   </p> 

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='history'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> <a id='x1-20002'></a>History</h3>
<p>To understand China’s tech sector today, and its possible future direction, it is
helpful to look to its past first. The three companies dominating it today, commonly
referred to as BAT as the equivalent to the US’s GAFA/GAFAM/FAANG, were
all founded relatively recently and close together, around the turn of the
millennium. Due to China’s digital isolationism, they were able to capture basically
the entire domestic Chinese market for themselves, as the party is quite
willing to tolerate monopolistic tendencies domestically if it believes that will
improve the competitiveness of Chinese companies, and by extension the
Chinese state, internationally. Additionally, their late entry allowed them
to (to put it charitably) learn a lot from other companies that had come
before them, and also jump over a lot of "intermediate technologies", for
example mobile devices have displaced desktops in China far more than most
                                                                  

                                                                  
Western countries, and similarly mobile payment is far more ubiquitous than
elsewhere.
</p> 
<p>   In part, the sector’s growth was fed by direct political support, as the Party has
in recent decades extensively pushed ahead the integration of information technology
into every aspect of life, and structured a lot of its broader political goals
around that, and in another part by transnational capital, which the Party is
surprisingly tolerant of, and which has sought to capitalise on this potential new
market<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xshen2019techgiants'>17</a>]</span>.
</p> 
<p>
   </p> 

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='companies-under-the-chinese-regime'><span class='titlemark'>2.1   </span> <a id='x1-30002.1'></a>Companies under the Chinese regime</h4>
<p>The relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and system of government
and companies existing under it is often misunderstood by casual observers. One
might assume that being an authoritarian regime, companies commonly get direct
orders from the government about current international policy and internal rules;
however such requests are in fact relatively rare. While police can and do
use their extensive powers to access user data, and there is of course an
administrative authority in charge of what content precisely gets censored or
allowed, at a larger level the Party’s control over private companies is far more
implicit by expectation than explicitly executed by traditional government
powers.
</p> 
<p>   Party leaders need not send companies specific directions on things like political
positions to take, countries to avoid, or foreign companies to do business
with, as businesses are expected to and commonly will act in concert with
the state of their own accord. Repressive measures are of course possible,
and if corporations or individuals fail to play along, public examples are
occasionally made (one need only think of the immediate and swift retribution
against Jack Ma and his Ant Group, see <a href='#ant-financial'>3.2.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: antgroup  --></a>  but usually they are not
necessary. This sort of implicit cooperation is required of any company who
wishes to exist in the Chinese market, enforced on foreign companies by
requiring them to form a joint venture majority owned by a Chinese company
and enforced on local companies directly against both the company and its
officers.
</p> 
<p>   On the positive side for both the regime and the companies, it allows them to act
basically as one especially where foreign policy is concerned, as whenever Party
leaders make public political declarations they can expect their entire economy to
immediately follow along, and in return Chinese companies can receive a surprising
amount of freedom from regulation and backing by the government against
international competitors. As touched upon earlier, the Party tolerates a fairly
strong oligopoly of just three companies taking over vast swathes of the
tech sector, as well as industrial espionage, and in more physical sectors like
mining and manufacturing environmental damage and bad work conditions are
similarly considered acceptable in the name of strengthening China’s economic
position.
</p> 
<p>
                                                                  

                                                                  
   </p> 

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='present'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> <a id='x1-40003'></a>Present</h3>
<p>Today, three companies dominate the Chinese tech sector. I will superficially go into
the activities of each, however I recommend the interested reader look at the
references for further details, as each of these three companies is functionally a
conglomerate active in a huge number of sectors.
   </p> 

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='baidu'><span class='titlemark'>3.1   </span> <a id='x1-50003.1'></a>Baidu</h4>
<p>Baidu, founded in 2000, is a fairly close equivalent to Alphabet née Google. Its core
product is the eponymous search engine, which has a market share of over 80%, but
like Google they expanded into adjacent sectors. Today they have expanded into
news, maps, translation, online advertising, and cloud storage<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xbaidu2022products'>2</a>]</span>. Additionally,
Baidu has a relatively large AI research division, running the platform Baidu Brain
to offer those capabilities to outside developers. As the registrant on over 9,000
AI-related patent applications, Baidu is the largest driver of AI research and
development in the entirety of China<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xprnewswire2020baidu'>3</a>]</span>.
   </p> 

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='alibaba'><span class='titlemark'>3.2   </span> <a id='x1-60003.2'></a>Alibaba</h4>
<p>Alibaba primarily deals in e-commerce, operating the largest B2B, C2C,
and B2C marketplaces in the world with Alibaba.com, Taobao, and Tmall
respectively. Like their mirror in the US, Amazon, Alibaba has also dealt in
cloud computing since 2009, being China’s largest provider of public cloud
services<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xalibaba2022businesses'>1</a>]</span>.
   </p> 

   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='ant-financial'><span class='titlemark'>3.2.1   </span> <a id='x1-70003.2.1'></a>Ant Financial</h5>
<p>Ant Financial, now known as Ant Group, is a spin-off of Alibaba handling its
payment services business, primarily Alipay, one half of the duopoly in the Chinese
mobile payment market. It was expected to make a record-setting IPO in 2021, when
it unexpectedly got pulled at the last second over supposed regulatory concerns.
This happened shortly after Jack Ma, the founder of the Alibaba group and
currently the richest man in China, publicly made some criticisms of Chinese
financial regulators, in an obvious act of retaliation that is rumoured to have
been ordered by Chairman Xi Jinping personally. Afterwards, Ma was not
seen for months, and has only made two appearances in total since<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xguardian2021jackma'>12</a>]</span>.
This particular event mirrors a larger trend that has intensified under Xi’s
tenure, that while allowing businesses a lot of freedom in how they conduct
themselves also demands absolute loyalty to the Party, with occasional examples
that no one, not even the richest man in the country, is above the Party’s
control.
   </p> 

                                                                  

                                                                  
   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='tencent'><span class='titlemark'>3.3   </span> <a id='x1-80003.3'></a>Tencent</h4>
<p>Tencent is one of very few modern-day companies that can accurately be described as
a tech conglomerate. Its divisions cover vast and disparate parts of the tech sector,
and the companies it owns outright or has a stake in span the globe. As an example,
its computer games division owns, among others, all of Riot Games and a minority
stake in Epic Games, and the revenue of that division alone substantially exceeds
that of US competitor Valve (who runs the Steam platform)<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xpolygon2022tencentgaming'>10</a>]</span>. Similar
comparisons apply to its payment services division, which runs WeChat Pay and
through it holds the second largest share in the Chinese mobile payments
market.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xbusinessinsider2017wechatpay'>21</a>]</span> <br class='newline' />
</p> 
<p>   Additionally, its core messenger product, WeChat not only forms a huge part of
social media use in China, it serves multiple important functions beyond
that:
</p> 
<p>   Firstly, it serves as a "super-app", providing its own internal app store and
effectively acting as a gatekeeper to the Chinese mobile app market. This
allows apps to bypass the rules and scrutiny of Google and Apple’s stores, a
fact which both of those companies turn a blind eye to, and lets WeChat
functionally act as the main means by which China’s users access services
on their phone. The average user spends over 4 hours a day in WeChat,
easily beating the equivalent figure for all social media apps combined in the
US.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xbitrise2022superapps'>7</a>]</span>
</p> 
<p>   Secondly, as Chinese citizens abroad commonly rely on WeChat both to keep in
touch with relatives and read news from their home country, it provides a useful way
for the party to both keep their citizens abroad exposed to their propaganda and
keep them from assimilating into the foreign country’s culture too much, as well as
ensure they remain accessible to government surveillance even when largely out of
direct reach.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xhrw2020wechat'>23</a>]</span>
</p> 
<p>
   </p> 

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='future-projects'><span class='titlemark'>4   </span> <a id='x1-90004'></a>Future projects</h3>
<p>In the following section, I will attempt to provide a brief but hopefully still quite
informative glance at two of the most high-profile current Party projects,
how they’ve been portrayed by (largely US-centric) western media outlets,
and try to provide a more accurate image of those projects and their true
impact.
   </p> 

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='social-credit'><span class='titlemark'>4.1   </span> <a id='x1-100004.1'></a>Social Credit</h4>
<p>The social credit system is perhaps western media’s favourite shorthand for
technology being used by a dystopian surveillance state. However, the portrayal of
this system, or rather, these systems, as it exists in the media today is often at the
very least ill-informed if not actively misleading. Generally, it is shown as an
all-encompassing system, assigning each citizen a numeric score (somewhat similar to
a credit rating or SCHUFA score), considering everything from helping elderly people
                                                                  

                                                                  
cross the road to making politically unacceptable statements on social media. Every
move, the story goes, is evaluated and recorded, every second of a Chinese citizen’s
life recorded and evaluated using sophisticated surveillance technology and
algorithms.
</p> 
<p>   However, this is very much in contrast with the actual reality today. Originally
conceived in 2014 as an extension of a data system planned and used since 1999 for
purely economic data<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xprinceton2020socialcredit'>11</a>]</span>, it did not even mention an actual score value, and most
systems under the "social credit" umbrella do not in fact use numeric score
values. Additionally, there is a huge amount of fragmentation between systems
- most of the systems that exist today are not at the level of the central
government, but either pilot projects run by individual cities or regions,
or run by private companies. Many of these systems are also (as of 2021)
voluntary and do not carry the kind of global consequences imagined by typical
portrayals.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xvice2021socialcreditmeme'>26</a>]</span>
</p> 
<p>   Beyond that, a lot of the national system is not used as a punishment or
regulatory measure in its own right, but as additional punishment for acts that are
already being prosecuted, like tax evasion, theft, or riding public transit without a
ticket.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xsueddeutsche2019sozialkredit'>9</a>]</span>.
</p> 
<p>   Some observers have also pointed out that there is a substantial cultural
difference in what is expected of the state, and this may be part of why
Chinese citizens do not find the idea of moral expectations (like helping the
elderly and not making public statements causing political dissent) being
enforced by the state to be as offensive. This combined with the fact that
there is genuinely a substantial problem with both various kinds of fraud
and specifically tax evasion in current day China is important context in
understanding both the political motivation of these systems and the reaction to
them.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xwapo2018westwrong'>18</a>]</span>
</p> 
<p>   At the same time, we must be aware that by focusing on China as a supposed
"worst case" example of technological surveillance, we risk missing concerning
developments in our own region, like plain old credit rating agencies (e.g. SCHUFA)
growing increasingly data hungry (for example, considering residence address as a
predictor for trustworthiness), and governments (like Denmark and the Netherlands)
using algorithms for decisions in concerning ways, in everything from policing to
social services.
</p> 
<p>
   </p> 

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='digital-yuan'><span class='titlemark'>4.2   </span> <a id='x1-110004.2'></a>Digital Yuan</h4>
<p>The digital yuan, also referred to as the digital renminbi or e-CNY, officially Digital
Currency Electronic Payment, is one of the more interesting initiatives by the Party
in recent years. It is a central bank digital currency, that is to say, it is not a
cryptocurrency and largely retains the properties of conventional central bank
currencies (full control over money printing by a single institution, trust in central
institutions managing the currency).
</p> 
<p>   In practical everyday use, the digital yuan is a payment app installed on mobile
phones that functions as a wallet, allowing payment in stores using a QR code at no
fee, and allowing users to send money to each other instantly. To a western
observer (particularly in countries that are cash-heavy and have traditionally
                                                                  

                                                                  
slow banking systems where wire transfers are associated with high fees and
take multiple days like in the US), this may appear to be a revolutionary
leap forward in being able to conveniently handle monetary transactions;
however, to a Chinese citizen none of these features are particularly remarkable.
Mobile payments using the privately run WeChat Pay and Alipay already
make up the vast majority of payments, and they similarly allow for instant
transfers between users and convenient payment using a QR code. They
do impose a fee, commonly around 0.6%, on every merchant transaction,
but even that seems laughably low compared to merchant fees commonly
imposed on credit cards in other countries, which average between 2% and
4%.
</p> 
<p>   The core goal, then, isn’t to revolutionise how Chinese consumers pay for things,
so much as to take control of a trend that has been putting massive amounts of data
and control in the hands of private companies. The regime may well be
able to exert pressure on these companies, subpoena data on its users, and
even demand direct action against specific transactions, but none of that
compares to the ability to have access to every transaction passing through the
network in real time, apply whatever rules may be deemed necessary, and react
based on a comprehensive knowledge of the entire economy<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xmartenscentre2021digitalyuan'>15</a>]</span>. Viewed in
isolation from the Chinese government’s authoritarian nature, this is not even
necessarily a bad thing - this kind of insight enables entirely new approaches to
economic policy, as well as more direct, decisive action against fraud, tax
evasion, and corruption, presuming the digital currency meaningfully displaces
its physical equivalent. Indeed, this is part of the reason more democratic
countries are very much interested in considering similar digital currency
initiatives<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xecb2022digitaleuro'>6</a>]</span>.
</p> 
<p>   All these concerns and opportunities for domestic users aside, for obvious reasons
most western observers have focused on the potential impact the digital yuan could
have internationally, some going so far as suggesting this is a direct threat
to the global dominance of the US dollar and the power the US wields by
weaponising that same dominance<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xwsj2021digitalyuan'>8</a>]</span>. However, as has been pointed out
by others, the US dollar is not the global reserve currency for any reason
related to its technical abilities, but the political and economic power of the
United States, and making it digital does nothing to fundamentally alter the
renminbi’s international position, particularly since it is still subject to strong
capital controls and traded at a fixed exchange rate pegged to a currency
basket<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xquartz2020digitalyuan'>13</a>]</span>.
</p> 
<p>   Not technically part of the digital yuan initiative, but certainly closely related
to it, is the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), which may
well be far more relevant for future international relations. CIPS is China’s
competitor to SWIFT, the payment network used near universally for transacting
international bank transfers outside domestic networks like the US ACH
network and Europe’s SEPA. SWIFT isn’t itself a financial institution, but it is
a secure communications standard providing a standardised interface for
banks to exchange messages about transactions which can then be settled
periodically between said banks. CIPS uses the same formats as SWIFT, but all
transactions are settled in RMB and the system is backed by the People’s Bank of
China<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xscmp2022cips'>19</a>]</span>. The obvious risk is that if China pressures its allies and particularly
countries owing it large debts to transact their business through CIPS, it would
dramatically diminish the US’s ability to globally enforce sanctions, which it
                                                                  

                                                                  
can do currently because a large percentage of SWIFT transactions are in
US dollars. Additionally, if China can establish a large global network of
institutions utilising CIPS, it could also be used to circumvent those same US
sanctions. As of June 2022, CIPS has 1341 participants<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xcips2022participants'>5</a>]</span>; the degree of
international adoption since CIPS’s launch in 2015 is in fact said to have
been a major factor in the renminbi’s addition to the IMF’s SDR currency
equivalents.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='recent-developments'><span class='titlemark'>5   </span> <a id='x1-120005'></a>Recent developments</h3>
<p>In recent years, starting with a crackdown beginning in 2020 but escalating to the
degree of some of the most obvious changes happening during the writing of this
paper, a lot of the behaviour of the Chinese Communist Party has been shifting
rapidly. The action against Ant Financial was one of the first actions in an escalating
series of regulatory crackdowns on the tech sector that would eventually wipe at least
1.5 trillion US dollars off the market capitalisation of China’s largest technology
companies<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xbloomberg2022crackdown'>24</a>]</span>.
</p> 
<p>   This crackdown has included both a complete change in policy on anti-monopoly
action, with Alibaba being forced to pay a record-breaking $2.8 billion fine<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xnytimes2021alibabafine'>25</a>]</span>, and
the introduction of new regulation on entire industries. This includes, but is not
limited to, new rules on video games (addiction to which is considered a
serious concern)<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xweforum2021videogames'>14</a>]</span>, as well as a fairly strict data privacy law modelled on
GDPR<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xcooley2021pipl'>4</a>]</span>.
</p> 
<p>   These changes, combined with the initiatives outlined in the prior section, show
an increasingly clear trend of the Chinese government (and by extension, the
Communist Party) shifting to once again more actively involve itself in the economy,
as well as its citizens life as the country grows more authoritarian under the new
chairman Xi Jinping. From an outside perspective this would surely be the most
dramatic shift in policy since Deng Xiaoping opened the country’s markets up to the
world in 1978. However, there is some potential for misunderstanding here - in some
aspects China may have become almost terminally capitalist over the last
decades, to the point that political positions were sold for cash<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xnpr2013forsale'>16</a>]</span>, but out of
hand though it might have gotten, capitalism and open markets were always
meant to be an intermediate stage, to, as Deng Xiaoping put it, "let some
people get rich first"<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xtheconversation2021dengxiaoping'>22</a>]</span> along the way to the ultimate goal of a communist
nation. Since his rise to power, Xi Jinping has certainly rung in a new era
in Chinese politics, but his actions could be considered to very much be
in the same spirit and towards the same goal as those who came before
him.<span class='cite'> [<a href='#Xscmp2022xijinping'>20</a>]</span>
</p> 
<p>
   </p> 

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='conclusion'><span class='titlemark'>6   </span> <a id='x1-130006'></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>China, by its very nature of being an authoritarian country with an ultimately
fairly direct ability of a small leadership being able to exert its will upon
                                                                  

                                                                  
the economy, has a very different set of tools at its disposal to react to the
risks and opportunities the rise of big technology companies is providing. As
evidenced by the regulatory crackdown over the last two years, the Party is
easily able to implement what in other countries might equate two decades
worth of tech regulation nearly instantaneously, however the lack of direct
accountability means not only can this power be abused for political means, there is
also not much of a path for corrective feedback, as shown by the extreme
regulation of video games that international experts are widely considering to be
misguided.
</p> 
<p>   Regardless, there are lessons to be learned for other countries, not just as a
warning how technology can be abused, but also in how some regulation can be used
for more positive ends.
